1. prints "values added: num1+num2" if add is true, where num1+num2 is the int sum of num1+num2
2. prints "final result: num1+num2" where num1+num2 is the same as the result from question 1
3. You shouldn't use var since it's harder to manage and mix up since it ignores code blocks and doesn't return errors when misusing
4. prints "values added: num1+num2" if add is true, where num1+num2 is the int sum of num1+num2
5. code returns error since the variable result created by let no longer exists outside the if statement
6. returns error because constant variables cannot be changed once assigned
7. code will not get to line 13, since it will either return an error due to question 6, or return from the else statement
